 Hi, I’m @RinuAnnie

This is my Obstacle Sensing Project implemented in Tinkercad

This project utilizes an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller along with an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (4-pin), three LEDs (red, yellow, and green)
and three 220Ω resistors to demonstrate obstacle sensing.

The objective of this project is to visually represent different ranges of distances between Ultrasonic Distance Sensor and the object(obstacle) using different colored LEDs. 

The green LED illuminates if the distance between the object and the sensor is greater than or equal to 50cm.
The yellow LED illuminates if the distance is greater than or equal to 20cm but less than 50cm.
The red LED illuminates if the distance is less than 20cm.
